# Arch Linux ARM packages

This repository holds some of my customized packages for Arch Linux mainly for the ARM platform like Raspberry Pi.


## libwebsockets

libwebsockets is a lightweight pure C library built to use minimal CPU and memory resources, and provide fast throughput in both directions.

Required by modified mosquitto package which has websockets enabled.

Current version: (stable) libwebsockets-1.6.0-chrome48-firefox42

## mosquitto

Mosquitto is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Current version: mosquitto-1.4.7
